### Prediction of percentage
 
**This project deals with the prediction of percentage of a student based on the number of study hours.
This project uses supervised machine learning to predict the percentage of the student.**

**Visualising the given dataset, I found a linear relation between the number of study hours and percentage of the students. So, I used linear regression to train the model. And later used the model to predict the scores. I evaluated the model to have a mean absolute error of 4.18**
